# Test Project

## Description

This is a test project created to demonstrate the Cursor agent workflow. It serves as a simple example for testing automated development processes and validating the agent's ability to create, commit, and push changes to a repository.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Check the branch**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   Ensure you're on the correct development branch.

3. **Explore the codebase**
   - Review the project structure
   - Check available documentation in the `.cursor/rules/` directory
   - Explore the Framework and Boomi_Processes directories

4. **Development workflow**
   - Make changes on feature branches
   - Commit frequently with descriptive messages
   - Push changes to the remote repository
